        <h2>About Daphne Dorman</h2>
        <p>Philadelphia native Daphne Dorman's career began with a 12 year journey as a stage and television performer, including a two year stint on QVC representing the Memorex line of consumer electronics. She served as the Director of Operations for The Actors Center of Philadelphia where she also spent several years teaching improvisation and stage combat. From there, she started her own web development agency, cutting her teeth on websites and apps for local businesses, including the acclaimed National Geographic photographer Steve McCurry (widely renowned for his "Afghan Girl" photos of Sharbat Gula).</p>

<p>After years of acting and running her own agency, Daphne moved to Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, an island 30 miles off the coast of Cameroon in Africa where she spent two years establishing a wildlife preserve and research station for primates and sea turtles. Upon her return to the United States, she moved to California where she took a role as Director of Information Technology for SCS Global Services in Emeryville, CA.</p>

<p>In 2016, she volunteered at the San Francisco LGBT Center serving as the instructor for Transcode, a series of classes aimed at training transgender members of our community for a career in technology with specific emphasis on programming for the internet. She currently serves as Senior Software Engineer for Vineti, Inc. and continues to fulfill her passions writing and acting on stage and screen.</p>
